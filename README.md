## Description

The Smart Home Control System is an embedded systems project that allows users to control various home automation functions using a keypad and an LCD screen. This project serves as a secure and convenient way to manage doors and lights in different rooms within a smart home environment.

The system employs AVR microcontrollers, SPI communication, and a custom keypad interface to provide users with functionalities such as door control and room light management. Users must log in with a password to access the system's features, and multiple fail login attempts can lead to account locking.
